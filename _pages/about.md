# To the readers
I am dedicated on human-centered AI, in particular on human behavior perceiving, understanding and synthesis in 3D. These tasks are not independent from each other, but are inherently the same. Namely, we say we understand a kind of behavior, only if we know how to precisely perceive and synthesize it.
Therefore, my research interests covers 3D body modelling, 3D body recovery from images/videos, stochastic motion prediction/generation, and modelling person-scene interactions. Their downstreaming applications include AR, VR, graphics, healthcare, sports, computer-aided desgin, and beyond.

I am currently a postdoc researcher at [Computer Vision and Learning Group (VLG), ETH Zurich](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch), led by Prof. Siyu Tang. In the meanwhile, I am a guest scientist at [Perceiving Systems Department, MPI Tuebingen](https://ps.is.mpg.de), and work closely with Prof. Michael J. Black and other colleagues. I got my PhD degree at Ulm University with *magna cum laude*, supervised by Prof. Heiko Neumann.

# 致读者
我致力于以人为本的人工智能研究，特别是3D环境中人的行为感知，理解和生成。这些任务并不是相互独立的， 而是具有本质的相同点。只有在知道如何精确感知和生成一类行为后，我们才说，我们理解了这种行为。因此，我的研究兴趣涵盖了3D人体建模，图片和视频中的3D人体重建，人体运动不确定预测和生成，以及建模人和场景的交互。它们的下游应用包括增强现实，虚拟现实，图形学，健康医疗，体育，计算机辅助设计等等。

我目前在苏黎世联邦理工大学，Siyu Tang教授领导的VLG组从事博士后研究。同时，我是德国马克斯普朗克智能系统所感知系统部的客座科学家，同Michael J. Black教授及其他同事有紧密的合作。我于德国乌尔姆大学取得计算机博士学位，由Heiko Neumann教授指导。
