# To the readers

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am currently a PhD student at the institute of neural information processing, Ulm University, Germany. After obtaining M.Sc degree in University of Manchester in advanced control engineering, I jointed the graduate school of computer science in Saarland University. In parallel, I was working in Max Plunck Institute of Informatics (MPII) and the Mathematical Image Analysis group of Saarland University as a research assistant. Afterwards, I was doing an internship in German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg, Germany, and then joined my current institute. 

My research experiences mainly incorporate image processing based on differential equation and variational calculus, as well as computer vision and machine learning methods on medical image analysis, human behavior understanding and others. I have several publications in these domains, provide oral presentations in international conferences and serve as the reviewer for the SPIE journal of medical imaging, PLoS One and others.


Yours faithfully,

Yan

# 给读者的信

尊敬的读者，

我现在正在德国乌尔姆大学神经信息处理中心攻读博士学位。在获得英国曼彻斯特大学硕士学位后，在前辈的点拨下，我来到德国萨尔大学研究生院学习计算机科学。同时，我曾于马克斯普朗克信息所和萨尔大学数学图像处理组担任研究助理。之后，我去到德国癌症研究中心实习，并于一年以后来到了乌尔姆，加入目前的机构。

我的研究经历主要包含了，基于微分方程和变分微积分的图像处理，以及计算机视觉和机器学习在医学图像分析和人体行为分析的应用。我在这些领域里面发表过文章，在国际会议上做过口头报告，以及为SPIE journal of medical imaging, PLoS One 等学术期刊审阅论文。


此致 
敬礼
