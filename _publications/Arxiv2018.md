__Abstract:__ 
We present an effective dynamic clustering algorithm for the task of temporal human action segmentation, which has comprehensive applications such as robotics, motion analysis, and patient monitoring. Our proposed algorithm is unsupervised, fast, generic to process various types of features, and applicable in both the online and offline settings. We perform extensive experiments of processing data streams, and show that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art results for both online and offline settings.
