__Abstract:__ 

Detecting unintended falls is essential for ambient intelligence
and healthcare of elderly people living alone. In recent years, deep
convolutional nets are widely used in human action analysis, based on
which a number of fall detection methods have been proposed. Despite
their highly effective performances, the behaviors of how the convolutional
nets recognize falls are still not clear. In this paper, instead of
proposing a novel approach, we perform a systematical empirical study,
attempting to investigate the underlying fall recognition process.We propose
four tasks to investigate, which involve five types of input modalities,
seven net instances and different training samples. The obtained
quantitative and qualitative results reveal the patterns that the nets
tend to learn, and several factors that can heavily in
uence the performances
on fall recognition. We expect that our conclusions are favorable
to proposing better deep learning solutions to fall detection systems.
