__Abstract:__ 
Parsing continuous human motion into meaningful segments plays an essential role
in various applications. In this work, we propose a hierarchical dynamic clustering
framework to derive action clusters from a sequence of local features in an unsupervised
bottom-up manner. We systematically investigate the modules in this framework
and particularly propose diverse temporal pooling schemes, in order to realize accurate
temporal action localization. We demonstrate our method on two motion parsing tasks:
temporal action segmentation and abnormal behavior detection. The experimental results
indicate that the proposed framework is significantly more effective than the other related
state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
