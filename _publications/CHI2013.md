Abstract

We study the design of split keyboards for fast text entry with two thumbs on mobile touchscreen devices. The layout of KALQ was determined through first studying how users should grip a device with two hands. We then assigned let- ters to keys computationally, using a model of two-thumb tapping. KALQ minimizes thumb travel distance and maxim- izes alternation between thumbs. An error-correction algo- rithm was added to help address linguistic and motor errors. Users reached a rate of 37 words per minute (with a 5% error rate) after a training program.
