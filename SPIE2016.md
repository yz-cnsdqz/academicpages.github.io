__Abstract:__ 
Intra-operative tissue classification is one of the prerequisites for providing context-aware visualization in computer-assisted minimally invasive surgeries. As many anatomical structures are difficult to differentiate in conventional RGB medical images, we propose a classification method based on multispectral image patches. In a comprehensive ex vivo study we show (1) that multispectral imaging data is superior to RGB data for organ tissue classification when used in conjunction with widely applied feature descriptors and (2) that combining the tissue texture with the reflectance spectrum improves the classification performance. Multispectral tissue analysis could thus evolve as a key enabling technique in computer-assisted laparoscopy.
